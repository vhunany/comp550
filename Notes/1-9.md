# Notes for 1/9 - FDOC```

## Questions we want to answer

1. How do we know the algorithm is correct? 
  - ex. We want to find the max value in the array. 
  - How do you know it will return the max value? 

2. What is the runtime? (We don’t mean the wall clock time because it depends on the input and changes machine to machine, and where the program is implemented ex in python or C). 
  - We know about primitive operations. These are basic operations: 
    * Assignment (`x = b`)
    * Basic arithmetic
    * Conditional/comparison (`if x < y`)
    * Indexing `A[5]`
    * `x = A[5]`

  - Can be extremely precise. (We usually don’t do this)
    * ex. 3n + log2(n)+26
      If you put in n = 10, they this equation will give you the exact number of primitive operations.
